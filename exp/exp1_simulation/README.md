# Experiment 1: Simulation Studies

This directory contains experiments evaluating the performance of various optimal sampling strategies under synthetic high-dimensional data. The experiments compare the proposed **Optimal Sample Split Selection Tests** and **Optimal Sample Split Rank Tests** with the baseline methods, **Naive (Traditional) Sample Split Test** and **Bonferroni Correction**. 


## Main Simulation Scripts
- `optimal_sampling_method_naive.R`: Implements a naive version of the optimal sampling strategy that performs hypothesis testing with only one outcome selected among the planning sample.
- `optimal_sampling_method_select.R`: Implements the "selection-based" optimal sample split method. Uses a small planning sample to select promising hypotheses before conducting confirmatory tests on an independent analysis sample.
- `optimal_sampling_method_rank.R`: Implements the "ranking-based" optimal sample split method. Hypotheses are ranked using statistics from the planning sample, and the analysis sample is used to evaluate those ranks.
- `vanilla_method_Bonferroni.R`: Implements a baseline Bonferroni correction method for multiple testing. Serves as a reference for evaluating the power and sensitivity of proposed methods.


## Subdirectories
üìÅ `data_generate_script/`: Contains R scripts for simulating synthetic datasets with structured treatment effects.

üìÅ `visualization/`: Contains scripts to create performance visualizations (e.g., power curves) from simulation results.


### üìÅ `scripts/`
**Purpose**:  
Stores shell scripts (`.sh`) designed for HPC job submission, especially for Slurm-based clusters. These scripts allow for parallel or array-based execution of simulation and plotting jobs.

Examples:
- `*_array.sh`: Submits a job array for multiple simulations.
- `*_plot_example.sh`: Runs plotting scripts on cluster nodes.

## Notes

- All `.R` scripts assume the working directory is at the top level of the project.
- Simulation results are saved to `output/` folders organized by method and parameters.
- Use scripts from the `scripts/` folder to automate large-scale simulation or plotting tasks in HPC environments.

This structure is intended to separate core logic (`.R` scripts), HPC batch utilities (`scripts/`), data generation (`data_generate_script/`), and post-processing (`visualization/`).
